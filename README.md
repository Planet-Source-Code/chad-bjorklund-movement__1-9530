## Movement

### Description

This code shows how to move an object along exact angles using trigonometry. I made it after I download a sprite that could face 32 different directions. Instead of doing some complex movement function like I'd done before, I made this technique. Now all I had to do was increment a variable by 11.25 (360/32)

I am sure that I am not the first at doing this, it's just that I had never seen it on the internet before so I thought I would put it up and help all of those who could use it. I just put it into a simple project where you drive a tank around.

The project could be used for a game too, if you want, e-mail me and I will send you the better graphics, the ones I used are shrunk and 8-bit instead of 24.

Anyways, download the code and enjoy, all feedback is welcome.
